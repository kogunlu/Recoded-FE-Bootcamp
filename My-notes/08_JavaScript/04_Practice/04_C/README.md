# JS Array and Loops lab

## Overview

You will create functions that simulate the actions of registering and maintainging student's records.

## Instructions

1. Create 2 arrays for students' names and their grades.
2. Create a function called `registerStudentGrade` that adds a new student to the students array and their grade to the grade array
3. Create a function called `getStudentName` that takes one argument `id` and returns the student's name from the array.
4. Create a function called `getStudentGrade` that takes one argument `id` and returns the student's grade from the array.
5. Create a function called `getStudentInfo` that takes one argument `id` and returns both the student's name and their grade from both arrays
6. Create a function called `getAverageScore` that takes all the scores and returns the average score
7. Create a function called `getHighestScore` that takes gives you the highest scorer with their score.
8. Create a function called `getPassingStudents` that returns all the students who scored more than 70.
9. Create a function called `graduateLastStudent` that removes the last student from both arrays.
