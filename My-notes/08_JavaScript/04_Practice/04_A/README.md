# Array Lab

## Instructions:

### Think of a meal you love!

1- Write an array of strings for the list of ingridents and items you need to make it!

2- Add a spice to the **end** of array! How about adding pepper if you have'nt already! (maybe sugar if you are doing something sweet)

3- Add another spice to the **beginning** of array! How about adding salt if you have'nt already! (a pinch of salt works with everything ðŸ§‚)

4- Ok, that's too much spices! can you remove both the **first** and the **last** elements of the array!

5- Defien a variable called mainIngredient from the array using its index.

6- Write a function that takes an array, checks all the elements in the array and logs everything other than the mainIngredient.

### Test cases:

if the main array includes the following items to create pizza: dough, tomato, cheese, pan, oven, mushroom.

Let's say our main ingredient is tomato then the result should be:
dough
cheese
pan
oven
